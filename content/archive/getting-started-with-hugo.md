Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator that makes building websites a breeze. In this post, I'll share my experience getting started with Hugo.

## Why Hugo?

Hugo offers several advantages:

- **Speed**: Hugo is incredibly fast, building sites in milliseconds
- **Simplicity**: Minimal setup required to get started
- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable with themes and layouts
- **No dependencies**: Single binary makes deployment easy

## Getting Started

To create a new Hugo site, simply run:

```bash
hugo new site mysite
```

Then create your first post:

```bash
hugo new blog/my-first-post.md
```

## Building and Deploying

Build your site with:

```bash
hugo
```

This generates a `public` directory with your static site ready to deploy anywhere.

## Conclusion

Hugo has been a great choice for building fast, maintainable websites. Its simplicity and speed make it perfect for blogs and portfolios.
