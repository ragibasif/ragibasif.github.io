A clean, responsive weather dashboard that displays current conditions and forecasts using public weather APIs.

## Overview

This weather dashboard provides an intuitive interface for checking weather conditions across multiple locations with detailed forecasts and weather data visualization.

## Features

- **Current Conditions**: Real-time weather data for any location
- **7-Day Forecast**: Extended forecast with daily summaries
- **Multiple Locations**: Save and switch between favorite locations

## Technical Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies
- **Weather API**: Integration with OpenWeatherMap API
- **LocalStorage**: Save user preferences and locations
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Responsive layout system

## Challenges

Working with weather APIs taught me about:

- API rate limiting and caching strategies
- Handling different units (metric/imperial)
- Displaying time zones correctly
- Error handling for network requests

## User Experience

Focused on making weather information scannable and easy to understand:

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Icons for weather conditions
- Color coding for temperature ranges
- Minimal clicks to access information

## Performance Optimizations

- Caching API responses to reduce requests
- Lazy loading of forecast data
- Optimized images for weather icons
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size

## What I Learned

This project improved my skills in:

- Working with third-party APIs
- Handling asynchronous JavaScript
- Creating responsive layouts
- User experience design
