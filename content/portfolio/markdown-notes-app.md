A simple, browser-based markdown notes application with local storage for quick note-taking and documentation.

## Project Description

This lightweight notes app allows users to write, edit, and organize notes using Markdown syntax. All notes are stored locally in the browser.

## Key Features

- **Markdown Support**: Full markdown rendering with live preview
- **Local Storage**: Notes saved automatically in browser
- **Search**: Quick search across all notes
- **Export**: Download notes as markdown files
- **Tagging**: Organize notes with tags
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes

## Technical Implementation

Built with vanilla JavaScript to keep the bundle size small and performance high. Key technologies:

- Native browser APIs for storage
- Markdown parsing library for rendering
- CSS Grid for responsive layout
- No build process required

## Design Decisions

Chose to use local storage rather than a backend to keep the app simple and privacy-focused. Users own their data completely.

## Learning Outcomes

This project deepened my understanding of:

- Browser storage APIs
- Markdown parsing and rendering
- State management without frameworks
- Building useful tools with minimal dependencies

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:

- Sync across devices
- Collaborative editing
- Export to multiple formats
- Cloud backup options
