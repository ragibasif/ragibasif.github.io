A minimal, fast-loading personal website and blog built with Hugo and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Project Overview

This website serves as both a portfolio and a blog, showcasing my work and sharing my thoughts on web development and technology.

## Technologies Used

- **Hugo**: Static site generator for fast builds
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated build and deployment workflow
- **Custom CSS**: Minimal, responsive styling without frameworks

## Features

- Clean, minimal design focused on content
- Fast page loads with no JavaScript required
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Automatic deployment on every commit
- RSS feed for blog posts

## Design Goals

The design prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, distraction-free reading experience
2. **Performance**: Fast loading on all devices and connections
3. **Maintainability**: Simple codebase easy to update and modify
4. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper contrast ratios

## Challenges

Building a minimal site requires discipline to resist adding unnecessary features. The challenge was creating something functional and attractive while keeping the codebase simple.

## Results

The site loads in under 1 second, requires no build tools beyond Hugo, and is easy to maintain. It's proven to be a stable, long-term solution.
