Markdown has become the standard format for blogging and content creation. Here's why it's such a great choice.

## Simple and Readable

Markdown files are plain text. You can read and write them in any editor. No special software required. No vendor lock-in.

```markdown
# This is a heading

This is a paragraph

-   This is a list item
```

## Portable and Future-Proof

Because Markdown is just plain text, your content will outlive any blogging platform. You can easily migrate to different tools without losing your work.

## Perfect for Static Site Generators

When combined with static site generators like Astro, Markdown provides the perfect workflow:

1. Write in Markdown
2. Add frontmatter for metadata
3. Generate static HTML
4. Deploy anywhere

## The Frontmatter

At the top of each Markdown file, you can add YAML frontmatter to store metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
date: 2025-12-25
excerpt: A short description
---
```

## Conclusion

Markdown + static site generation = powerful, simple, and sustainable blogging.
