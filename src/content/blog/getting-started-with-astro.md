Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build fast websites using your favorite JavaScript framework or no framework at all.

In this post, we'll explore the basics of Astro and why it's becoming so popular among developers.

## What makes Astro special?

1. **Performance**: Astro ships zero JavaScript by default
2. **Flexibility**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML
3. **Developer Experience**: Great tooling and easy to learn

Whether you're building a blog, documentation site, or marketing page, Astro provides the perfect balance of performance and developer experience.

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-blog
cd my-blog
npm run dev
```

That's it! You now have a running development server.

## Key Concepts

-   **Pages**: Files in `src/pages/` automatically become routes
-   **Layouts**: Reusable page templates
-   **Components**: Build with your favorite framework

The power of Astro is in its flexibility and performance-first approach.
