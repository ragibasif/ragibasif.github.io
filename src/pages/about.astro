            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my blog. I'm a developer passionate about building
                things on the web. This is where I share thoughts, ideas, and
                lessons learned along the way.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>
                I spend most of my time writing code, experimenting with new
                technologies, and thinking about how to build better user
                experiences. I'm particularly interested in modern web
                development, design systems, and open source.
            </p>

            <h2>About This Blog</h2>

                This blog is built with Astro and serves as a space for me to
