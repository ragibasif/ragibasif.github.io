      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a systems-oriented developer exploring the intersection of low-level
        software, minimal UI, and purposeful design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently studying Computer Science. I build software to better
        understand how systems really work â€” from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care deeply about accessibility, clarity, and technology that empowers
        rather than distracts.
